# a3c-rl
Asynchronous methods for DRL, however, it's hard to train a agent. In my experiment Pong, I only reach a average reward of about 12 no matter how I turn the parameters. The paper show that a3c algorithm will beat the AI every time after 10 hours training. Maybe there are some bugs in my program.
